# game-tracker
project for tracking what games you are playing and when and creating your own profile site

## current ideas
* Long term - make this very customizable
* Have an overall user profile screen that serves as a overall profile view
	* Could show currently playing game
	* Show a list of top X most played games
	* Show a list of most recent played games
	* Show a github like graph showing little game icons representing what games were played over which days over the span of a few months
* Have a specific game profile screen that represents the play information for a specific user + game
	* Full log view of all play times that have happened over the lifetime of the application
	* report of how many times you played the game each year
	* report of how many times you played the game each month
	* report of how many times you played the game each week
	* report of how many times you played the game each day
	* graph of time spent in game each day
	* patient gamer? how long did you wait to play this game after release
